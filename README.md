Small test website to showcase my projects.  
Unfinished but I did make some interesting metaball buttons which I think is unique  
It ran in software however so it wasn't very performant. Today I would use WebGL or WebGPU for fragment shaders  

I decided to abandon this project as while having a website is cool, I'm not that interested in webdev so it wasn't very useful or fun to work on.
